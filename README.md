Assorted scripts and stuff
==========================

This is the (abridged) contents of my personal `bin` directory on my personal
computers.

Some of these scripts are more useful than others, a few are just wrapper scripts
for other programs, and some (like `sex`) are just silly.  Most scripts are not
documented; you will need to read the code to see how they work (some will print
usage information when invoked with no arguments).

Unless otherwise noted, all of these scripts are mine and are released under the
X11 License.  See `LICENSE.md` for details.
